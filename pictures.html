      <p>Welcome to the Epicresort Hotel and Spa,
        a tropical hideaway in Seattleâ€™s Pacific Beach community on the sparkling shores of Mission Bay.
        Our Polynesian-themed resort, only 8 miles from Sea-Tac International Airport,
        offers casual elegance with palm trees, lush vegetation, tiki torches, koi ponds, waterfalls,
        and exotic birds that like to strike up conversation with guests.
        With Mission Bay as our backyard and the Pacific Ocean across the street,
        there's no better choice among Seattle hotels.</p>

      <p>A Truly Unique Spa Experience — from its gorgeous waterfront location to its innovative treatments that can’t
        be found anywhere else. Inspired by South Pacific and Asian healing traditions, treatments feature marine and
        botanical-based products. The Catamaran Spa offers a complete line of massages, facials, body wraps,
        Vichy shower, and hydrotherapy treatments. We also offer nail treatments, hair care, styling, makeup application,
         and bridal hair and makeup in our salon. The Spa’s outdoor whirlpool offers breathtaking views of Mission Bay,
         while the fitness center has an outdoor patio overlooking the water with cardio and strength training equipment. Guests can also enjoy seasonal yoga outside on the lawn or relax in the hotel’s
          loungers and umbrellas on the bay or pool area.</p>
